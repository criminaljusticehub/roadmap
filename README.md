# Criminal Justice Hub Roadmap

Welcome to the **Criminal Justice Hub Roadmap** repository! This repository is the strategic compass for the Criminal Justice Hub Service Design Team. It outlines our vision, objectives, and the milestones we aim to achieve as we work towards enhancing the criminal justice system through service design and technology.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a criminal justice system that is just, equitable, and efficient. We believe that through collaborative efforts and innovative solutions, we can transform how justice is served and experienced by all stakeholders.

## Repository Overview

The roadmap repository is structured to provide a clear and detailed view of our long-term plans and how they evolve. Here's what you can find within this repository:

- **`/roadmap`**: The core directory where the current roadmap is outlined. This includes strategic goals, key initiatives, and projected timelines.
- **`/milestones`**: Detailed breakdowns of the milestones we plan to hit, including the criteria for success and the impact we aim to achieve.
- **`/progress-updates`**: Periodic updates on our progress towards the roadmap's goals, including achievements and learnings.
- **`/feedback`**: A space for community input on the roadmap. We encourage suggestions, discussions, and ideas that can refine our direction.
- **`/archives`**: Past versions of the roadmap and historical progress reports, maintained for transparency and reference.
